Description: # pysmps
        
        This is a utility script for parsing MPS and SMPS file formats. It offers two main functions `load_mps` for loading mps files and `load_smps` for loading smps file directory.
        
        ### `load_mps`
        
        The `load_mps(path)` method takes a `path` variable as input. It should be a .cor or .mps file.
        It opens the file with read-permissions and parses the described linear program into the following format:
        
        - `name`: The name given to the linear program (can't be blank)
        - `objective_name`: The name of the objective function value
        - `row_names`: list of row names
        - `col_names`: list of column names
        - `types`: list of constraint type indicators, i.e. either "E", "L" or "G" for equality, lower/equal or greater/equal constraint respectively.
        - `c`: the objective function coefficients
        - `A`: the constraint matrix
        - `rhs_names`: list of names of right hand sides (there can be multiple right hand side components be defined, seldom more than one though)
        - `rhs`: dictionary `(rhs_name) => b`, where `b` is the vector of constraint values for that given right hand side name.
        - `bnd_names`: list of names of box-bounds (seldom more than one)
        - `bnd`: dictionary `(bnd_name) => {"LO": v_l, "UP": v_u}` where `v_l` is the vector of lower bounds and `v_u` is the vector of upper bound values (defaults to `v_l = 0` and `v_u = +inf`).
        
        Finally this corresponds to the linear program
        
        ```python
        min 	c * x
        
        s.t.	for each rhs_name with corresponding b:
        
        			A[types == "E",:] * x  = b[types == "E"]
        			A[types == "L",:] * x <= b[types == "L"]
        			A[types == "G",:] * x >= b[types == "G"]
        
        		for each bnd_name with corresponding v_l and v_u:
        
        			v_l <= x < v_u
        
        ```
        
        ### `load_smps`
        
        This function makes use of the `load_mps` function for parsing the .cor file. The SMPS file format consists of three files, a .cor, .tim and .sto file. The .cor file is in MPS format. Further the function expects a parameter `path` to be such that `path + ".cor"` is the core file, `path + ".tim"` the time file and `path + ".sto"` is the stochastic file.
        It *does not* support scenarios yet!
        It returns a stochastic multi-stage problem in the following format
        
        - `name`: name of the program (must be the same in all 3 files)
        
        - `objective_name`: name of the objective function value
        
        - `constraints`: list of tuples `(name, period, type)` for each constraint. It gives a name, a period in which the constraints appears and a type, i.e. "E", "L" or "G" as in MPS.
        
        - `variables`: list of tuples `(name, period, type)` for each variable. It defines a name and a period in which the variable joins the program. `type` denotes a string that is either integral or continuous depending on whether the INTORG MARKER was set when instantiating the variable.
        
        - `c`: vector of objective function coefficients (of all periods)
        
        - `A`: matrix of constraint coefficients (of all periods)
        
        - `rhs_names`: list of rhs names as in MPS
        
        - `rhs`: dictionary as in MPS
        
        - `bounds`: dictionary as in MPS
        
        - `periods`: list of all periods appearing. `len(periods)` is the number stages.
        
        - `blocks`: dictionary of `Block`,`LinearTransform` or `SubRoutine` objects. Dependent on what the .sto file defined. `Blocks` are independent random variables (every case of a `Block` must be combined with each case of another `Block` to get all possible appearences; the probabilities multiply), `LinearTransform` are linear transformations of continuous random variables. The user needs to write the sample script on his own. `SubRoutine` is a left-out in the file; it presupposes the user to know what to do with these values.
        
        - `independent_variables`: dictionary `((i,j)) => {position, period, distrib}`, where `(i,j)` is the tuple of row/column indices. If one of them is `-1` this means that it's either an objective value or a rhs-value respectively. `position` is a dictionary adapting to where the entry is (objective value, rhs value or matrix value), `period` defines the period in which this variable is stochastic, `distrib` is either a definition of a continuous random variables
        
          ```python
          distrib: {type: "N(mu, sigma**2)"/"U(a, b)"/"B(p, q)"/"G(p, b)"/"LN(mu, sigma**2)", parameters}
          ```
        
          where parameters is a dictionary defining the required parameters. In the discrete case it is a list of tuples `(v,p)`, where `v` is the value of this position and `p` is the probability of it appearing.
        
        For an example on how to use this format i recommand looking at the code for `load_2stage_problem`.
        
        ### `load_2stage_problem`
        
        Loads a SMPS directory and tries to bring it into a 2-staged stochastic linear program with fixed recourse. Output is a dictionary containing the values
        
        - `c`: first stage objective function value
        - `A`: first stage (equality) constraint coefficient matrix
        - `b`: first stage constraint values
        - `q`: list of second stage objective function coefficients (each case one entry)
        - `h`: list of second stage constraint values (each case one entry)
        - `T`: list of second stage constraint values for deterministic variables (each case one entry)
        - `W`: recourse matrix (since it's fixed recourse this is not a list)
        - `p`: list of probabilities for each case
        
        The constellations in which `(q,h,T,W)` appear are the realizations given by `(q[k], h[k], T[k], W)`.
        The problem then resembles one of the form
        
        ```python
        min		c * x + E_p[q * y]
        
        s.t.	A * x         = b
            	T * x + W * y = h
            	x, y >= 0
        ```
        
        which is a formal expression since T and h are also stochastic. In fact this notation means we assert the stochastic constraints inside of the expectation, making it a function of x only.
        
        For casting the SMPS files into such a form we need to make certain assertments:
        
        - The upper right matrix needs to be zeroes only.
        - We only have one righthand side defined (`len(rhs_names) == 1`).
        - There are no boundaries or if we defined some they are the default values.
        - The first period parsed from the time file is the deterministic one, the other one is the stochastic one (especially there can only be two periods).
        - `A` and `W` are not stochastic.
        
        This script however does
        
        - convert inequality constraints (deterministic and stochastic) into equality constraints by adding slack variables at the right places
        - calculate all combinations of independent accurances of stochastic components (BLOCKS and INDEP)
        - calculate the probabilities as products of independent elementary probabilities alongside.
